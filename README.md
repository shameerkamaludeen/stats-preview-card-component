## Overview

As usual, thought this challenge might finish within very less time but eventually took a lot of time stuck on a problem, at the end it's worth knowing how to solve and that information really is an asset in the future.

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this challenge tried a fully responsive card instead of fixed-width which was followed so far in the Frontend Mentor challenge, this was really a challenging one, especially trying to make a full window width body.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Height working but min-height doesn't work](https://stackoverflow.com/a/17969141/3877538)
- [height: 100% or min-height: 100% for html and body elements](https://stackoverflow.com/q/17555682/3877538) - The above sources gave an insight into an important problem that may arise while structuring the element with CSS.

## Acknowledgments

As usual Frontend Mendor gave me this opportunity to know an important problem regarding the browser windows and body's height or min-height relevant in structuring layouts through this wonderful challenge, I'm really thankful to them.
